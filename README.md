## Shell Simulation

This shell simulates a real shell in Linux with some basic functions. Users can type commands and run them in this shell, similar to a real Linux shell.

## Directories Structure

- `bin`: Directory for the executable files
- `obj`: Directory for the object files
- `inc`: Directory for the header files
- `src`: Directory for the source files
- `lib`: Directory for the static and shared libraries

## Code Usage

- `make all`: Build the runnable file
- `make mk_obj`: Build object files
- `make clean`: Clean files in `obj` and `bin`

sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
